INFO
This is a short trivia game of space puns. In this game you are able to login, create account, delete account, create characters, and delete characters. The objective is to navigate through the screens using your wits. If you lose your lives, the game is over and the character resets back to default. You are able to continue a past game if it was left unifinished.
